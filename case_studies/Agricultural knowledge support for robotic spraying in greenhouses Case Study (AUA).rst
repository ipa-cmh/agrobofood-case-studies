Agricultural knowledge support for robotic spraying in greenhouses Case Study
=============================================================================

GreenSprayer Industrial Challenge
---------------------------------
Performing disease detection and 3D spot spraying on plants, GreenSprayer will help to reduce the use of pesticides, protect the soil & aerial environment from chemical contamination and to improve production capacity in Greenhouses.

Technical Objectives
--------------------

* O.1 AGV Autonomous Navigation: The robot should be able to localize itself accurately and navigate safely in semi-structured environments such as greenhouses. This gives the robotic system the ability to reach different locations inside the greenhouse while detecting and avoiding the surrounding obstacles.

* O.2. Disease Detection System: The disease detection system accuracy is crucial for the spraying operation. Thus, a vision based algorithm will be integrated to achieve a successful detection of at least one of the following diseases: Tuta Absoluta, Downy Mildew, Whitefly in greenhouse tomatoes.

* O.3 AGV Platform: A four-wheeled skid steering AGV platform will be developed capable of carrying loads up to 100kg and hosting a variety of sensors (etc. IMU, lidar, cameras) for localization and environment perception.

* O.4 Mobile Manipulator Robotic System: The AGV platform will be modified and successfully integrated with a robotic arm and the appropriate sensors to be capable of accomplishing the navigation, detection and spraying tasks in the required environment (greenhouses).

* O.5 Spraying operation: The automated spraying procedure will be integrated with the whole robotic system fed with the disease detection and localization algorithms outputs. Thus, a proper spraying procedure of the detected infection areas will be achieved with limited spraying of healthy areas.

Service Provision Details
-------------------------

The experiment is coordinated by the company iKnowHow. While they have great capacity in terms of robotics and AI, they lack in agricultural knowledge concerning plant disease specifics, greenhouse operation and technical requirements for a robotic platform to be operational within a greenhouse environment.

**Agronomic Assistance:**

Including agricultural enginners, agronomists and plant pathologists, AUA assisted the experiment into narrowing down and identifying specific plants and diseases for the experiment implementation, based on plant availabillity, and disease appropriateness, considering also the available timeframe. The decision was made to focus on Tuta Absoluta infection on greenhouse tomatoes.

**Greenhouse Specifics:**

The experiment had no access to a greenhouse facility to perform their experiments. AUA, has provided with a dedicated greenhouse space for the experiment provision, while also helped in structuring said greenhouse for plant watering. The greenhouse structure was also influenced by the specific limitations that the robotic platform posseses (wheelbase, height, turn capabilities).
